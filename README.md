 ## My social networking site

 # About
 This project started as my 2021 AP Computer Science Principles Create Project.
 It was a small SocketIO realtime messageboard. After I was finished, I decided to make a new copy and continue with the project. 
 The goal is to have a fully fledged social networking platform.

 # Run
