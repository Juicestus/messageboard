 # About
 This project started as my 2021 AP Computer Science Principles Create Project.
 It was a small SocketIO realtime messageboard. After I was finished, I decided to make a new copy and continue with the project. 
 This is just practice for myself, I really have no intention of being Facebook 2.0. 
 
 # Run
